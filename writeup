Tristan:
Before I started testing, I tried to determine whether testing with raw sentiment values (-3, -2 -1, 0, 2,.. etc) was better than polarity (-1, 0, 1). Unsurprisingly, testing with polarity offered better results. All testing below were done based on polarity prediction (as specified by the competition spec)

While testing my features, I first tried the following features as char_based_features.
    F1 total number of characters in words(C)
    F2 total number of letters(a-z)/C
    F3 total number of upper characters/C
    F4 total number of digital characters/C
    F5 total number of white-space characters/C
    F6 total number of tab space characters/C
    F7 : : : F29 number of special characters(%,etc.)/C(23 features)
In order to optimize for the features, I tried the classification by holding a feature out, to asses weather the percentage improved.
