2	##The Canon 40D is the most camera for the money that Canon has ever provided.
3	##The highlights:  - The new improvded Autofocus: Yes  it's still 9 point  and I was skeptical about how improved it would actually be  but having used in the field on several photo shoots  I was able to compare it directly to my Canon 5D  and the AF on t
4	##The new system performs especially well with my 135mm 2.0L  and my 70-200mm 2.8L IS.
5	##But this is what is advertised about it (i.e.
6	##better performance with lens w/ Maximum apertures of 2.8 and greater).
7	##- The 3.0 LCD: Once again  comparing this to my 5D  which has a 2.5 display  the color reproduction is noticeably more accurate.
8	##Initially I thought that the colors were being captured differently by the camera  but when I realized they were very similar once I looked at them on the computer  it became apparent the difference was in the display on the camera.
9	##Also  the display on the 40D is brighter.
10	##I have not yet noticed as dramatic a difference as Canon has made it seem in their product detail when viewed in sunlight  but especially in darker settings  it is noticeable that there's a difference.
11	##- The frame rate & buffer size: The increased buffer is very apparent  in particular at the low speed continuous setting (3 fps)  where the speed at 3fps seems faster than the 3fps on the 5D simply because it can continue shooting (seemingly endlessly).
12	##In the high speed continuous mode (6.5fps)  the speed is mind-boggling.
13	##I have not had a chance to fully test this out yet (look for a future edit to this).
14	##- The viewfinder: The size and brightness are noticeably & dramatically better.
15	##The look through the viewfinder is so improved over my old 20D  they almost can't be compared.
16	##It's not quite as big as the 5D  but not far off either.
17	##And it's just about as bright as the 5D  if not as bright.
18	##- The AF button on the back: Although I still use the regular half push on the shutter button the majority of the time  I have found the rear AF button to be very handy at times.
19	##At certain times  the way in which I hold the camera makes using the traditional half push much easier.
20	##However  as a tip  I have found that in focus-recompose situations  the rear AF button is invaluable  as it is MUCH easier to continue holding down the rear AF Button while recomposing and then snap the shot  whereas with the traditional system  it is m
21	##The menu system: The new tab based menu system is much more intuitive & much better than scrolling through one big list.
22	##If you've ever seen the menus on some of the more recent Powershot mini point and shoots  it's like that (similar specifically to my knowledge to the SD630  as that is the one I own).
23	##Battery management: I used this camera at the Redskins/Dolphins home game last week  and I have a routine of where and how much I take pictures  and how often the camera is on.
24	##My camera came in the day I had a photo shoot with a model later  so I put in a battery I had already charged to use with my 5D  and left the brand new battery to charge at home.
25	##So  I was using one of my old batteries  in other words.
26	##This was not a long photo shoot with this model  I shot maybe 50 pictures of the shoot with the 40D.
27	##I never changed the battery before the game & what was noticeable was that the indicator did not drop off of full until the end of the fourth quarter  right before they went into OT.
28	##Since I was shooting with a new 40D as opposed to my old 20D I was shooting more  also - probably 33% more than normal.
29	##And with the 20D  if the battery had just been charged and no other use  it would have been down from full by halftime  slightly beforehand.
30	##The camera is clearly managing the power consumption better.
31	##(NOTE: The one improvement that did not make the 40D  disappointingly  is a better battery indicator - it's still the same annoying little 3 bars  of which 2 always go away when it drops from full  so really a two bar indicator).
32	##- The speed of scrolling through pictures: I know this has to be a result of the DIGIC III processor.
33	##It's absurdly better than the 20D or the 5D.
34	##If you scroll the knob real quick to zip through a bunch of pcitures  it's there in a second or less.
35	##The best way I can describe it is the difference in a computer that you'd been running 256MB RAM on & you just upped it to 1GB.
36	##It makes the Jump button seem almost unneccesary  however  I'm glad that it's still there!
37	##- Picture Style Button: This is very convenient.
38	##I hated looking for that through the long menu.
39	##- Flash management: I don't have the new 580EX II yet  but with the 580EX  it's still noticeable that when using the E-TTL automatic mode  it does a better job of managing the output  using a lower output at times when I know it would have overfired or 
40	##NOTE: I was using the external power pack also.
41	##But I'm making my assessment based on use of the power pack with the flash when using the old camera as well.
42	##- Visible ISO on the display on top.
43	##And better  although still familiar  layout on the top display.
44	##Assessment: In terms of specs  this camera is amazingly close to it's new big brother the 1D Mark III  more than past models have been.
45	##This is a big plus to those of us who don't have a fortune to spend on the top of the line Canon cameras.
46	##The image quality of this camera is not noticeably different than that in the 5D  although there is a slight difference when you look carefully.
47	##And of course it isn't full frame  which is a minus in certain applications  and a plus in others.
48	##The improvements between the 20D and the 30D were negligible  to say the least - it was clear Canon was just extending the lifecycle of the 20D  and the 30D should have been called the 20D Mark II.
49	##However  the 40D has many dramatic improvements over both of these previous models  and scrapes at the heels of the 5D in all of the areas where the 5D once had a clear advantage - let's hope for a 5D Mark II (or 7D  or whatever it will be called) soon.
50	##I've been reading rumors that it will be the 1st quarter of next year.
51	##I will admit that when this camera was first announced  and the Nikon D300 announcement came a few days later  Nikon caught my attention big time.
52	##But obviously  with all my investment in so much Canon equipment  it was a no-brainer to continue with Canon.
53	##Even to own both brands would be a considerable additional investment for that one body  as I have no Nikon lenses.
54	##At this point I will preach the gospel of L. To truly appreciate how good Canon photography can be  you need to own at least one L lens (although it will become more than one once you do  LOL).
55	##I own the highest rated (and still somewhat affordable) L lenses  the  Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM Lens for Canon SLR Cameras   the  Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS Image Stabilizer USM AF Telephoto Lens & Filters & 5 Year Warranty & Accessory Kit (both previou
56	##I haven't used the 100-400 on it yet just because I haven't had a chance or the right opportunity.
57	##They're all worth every penny  and I would note that the 135mm 2.0L might be the best lens  period.
58	##It's defintely my best one  although the 70-200 2.8L IS comes close.
59	##Once again  the 40D is the best body for the money that Canon makes.

2	##First off  I'm no camera pro - very amateur.
3	##I moved from my P&S to a DSLR this summer.
4	##My first DSLR was a Canon Rebel XT.
5	##While I was happy with the XT  it was too small for my hands.
6	##So I plunked down $$$ for this Canon EOS 40D with the 28-135mm IS lens.
7	##My review will compare the XT to the 40D (as that's all the DSLR experience I've had).
8	##I did not purchase this Canon EOS 40D from Amazon - that is why I've had this Camera since late August.
9	##First off  the 40D is the perfect size for my hands.
10	##The Rebel XT would leave my pinky hanging cramping my hands after a few shots.
11	##The Canon EOS 40D is perfect in terms of hand comfort.
12	##All my fingers fit on the grip making the camera feel very solid.
13	##The 40D's build quality feels a lot better than the XT.
14	##I noticed that my Rebel XT's autofocus would search a lot over and over.
15	##This was extremely annoying especially while trying to take moving pictures.
16	##I can tell that the 40D's autofocus is a bit faster and quite a bit more accurate in those situations.
17	##Be aware that the 40D weighs quite a bit more than the Rebel XT.
18	##I am still getting used to the weight.
19	##However  I am noticing that the heavier 40D is a lot easier to hold resulting in a clear shot than the Rebel XT (at least for me).
20	##The viewfinder is quite a bit bigger than the Rebel XT.
21	##I also noticed that it has a tint look and takes some getting used to.
22	##The viewfinder is a bit brighter than the XT as well.
23	##As far as the lens goes: I had a 28-105mm (nonIS) on my Rebel XT.
24	##The 28-135mm is awesome.
25	##It zooms further than I've ever needed it to.
26	##What I like the most is that it has a nice macro range (better than my 28-105mm lens).
27	##The autofocus is extremely fast.
28	##I'm sure the Image Stabilizer has saved many of my pictures...  At Large Fine picture sizes average around 4.5MB per shot.
29	##So be ready to have a large storage device handy nearby (I use my 500GB external drive).
30	##All in all - I will and have recommended the Canon EOS 40D as a good DSLR for the photography enthusiasts such as myself.
31	##I will be keeping this camera for many years.
32	##After all  the camera doesn't produce pro shots - the photographer does.
1	[t]
2	##I put a deposit on the 40D two days after it was announced and picked up my camera last week.
3	##I have the 5D and just sold my 30D after a few days with the new 40D.
4	##I'm a Sports Photographer for the most part  and the 3 FPS on the 5D just didn't feel adequate to me.
5	##My first experience with the 40D taught me to use K5200 for white balance indoor  and to make sure I'm not overexposed on my shots.
6	##Outdoor shots are beautiful  as are properly exposed indoor shots.
7	##Overexposed shots indoors have a ulgy yellow cast to them  I had to learn the camera.
8	##I really love the menu system on the 40D  it's so much easier & quicker then what's on the my 5D  it felt comfortable right away.
9	##The AF-ON button for tracking action shots is wonderful  and worth the money for the camera by itself.
10	##The image quality on the 40D is excellent  IMHO better then the 30D which is why I sold mine right away.I wanted a better camera for fast action that had picture quality like the 5D.
11	##The 40D is pretty close  nothing quite equals the 5D images ( I don't have the Mark 111 ).
12	##As far as comparing it to Nikon's D300 coming out  I just sold all my Nikon gear to switch to Canon low noise images.
13	##Now Nikon addresses the noise issue by coming out with the D300  for me it's too late.
14	##I have excellent Canon L lens and two great cameras  I'm satisfied.
1	[t]
2	##I'll start off by saying that yes  this really *is* a great camera.
3	##I bought it as body only  then added a Canon EF 100 f2.8 Macro USM lens.
4	##If you're not familiar with that lens  it is fairly heavy  and so the camera has felt heavy to me since day one.
5	##But it is the lens creating that impression.
6	##The 40D starts up  shoots  and shuts down quickly; With the right lenses  it creates clear and consistent photographs; it is hugely flexible  pretty much to any degree you want to flex.
7	##Some of the things that have made themselves known to me by how well they work are  in no particular order  the great battery life...
8	##I use the LCD a lot  shoot a lot  and generally fuss continuously with the camera  and it just keeps on going which is enormously pleasing (this is with the stock battery and a BP-511A spare pack to swap in.
9	##) The feel of the camera - just a nice handful of goodness  it really suits my hands  which are large.
10	##The clarity of the viewfinder.
11	##I wear glasses  and after a little playing with the adjustment  it was *perfect*  first time ever with any camera.
12	##This thing is *fast*; it really can do 6 or so frames a second (depends on the shutter speed  of course) and the AF is also fast which makes for more images  and more good images.
13	##I love all the preset modes  and I've already had some fun in manual and a *lot* of fun in aperture priority  which pretty much suits the way I think.
14	##I particularly like the AF display and the way you can control it; I prefer a single central AF point so I can control focus at the half-press point  and the camera was perfectly agreeable to that.
15	##More points did some interesting things with depth of field  and I look forward to experimenting with that  too.
16	##I would buy this camera body again in a heartbeat if something horrible happened to mine  like I dropped it down a well or larval (and soon to be deceased) human beings got hold of it and used it as a kickball.
17	##It also offers some optional features like wifi that sound like great fun  though I confess I can't speak to them as I've not tried them.
18	##There are some things I think could have been done better  though  and since you're probably looking at the camera wondering what the downsides are  rather than looking for what made everyone happy  that's what I'm going to focus on.
19	##o The worst problem  by far: The images that the camera uses to let you review your shots are FAR softer than the actual photos  to the point where you can't really tell if you got the focus nailed  or not.
20	##This is not a nitpick - this causes me to take extra shots because I literally can't tell if I've hit the mark  or not.
21	##I am hoping this can be fixed with a firmware update to the camera.
22	##o That fabulous LCD  huge and bright and crisp  looks awful every time I look at it after shooting through the TTL viewfinder.
23	##This is because it has a huge NOSEPRINT on it.
24	##Has anyone at Canon ever taken a look at a human face?
25	##Placement of the monitor should be offsides and inset so that it isn't a grease magnet.
26	##Or do they expect me to wash my nose every time I snap a picture out in the field?
27	##o While I'm harping on the camera's ergonomics  the power switch isn't very easy to manage.
28	##I have very short nails (I'm a guitarist and a martial artist  neither of which encourage nail growth) and getting that switch to swing on and off sometimes takes more than one try; that may  someday  lose me a photo I really wanted  especially consider
29	##I really wish it had a deeper pit for my finger and a more positive tractive surface to drag it on.
30	##It's too short and too smooth.
31	##o When in Live View mode  meaning  you're presumably shooting using the LCD instead of the viewfinder (after cleaning your latest noseprints off of it  of course)  autofocus doesn't work.
32	##But wait  it does.
33	##*If* you press a different button.
34	##Apparently the power budget of the camera is pushed a little too close to the edge if you use live view *and* autofocus because the mirror is locked in the up position.
35	##So they... moved AF to another button?
36	##Look  either let me do it  or don't let me do it  but quit changing what the controls do underneath my fingers.
37	##That's just poor interface design.

2	##As a 3 year dRebel (300D) owner - I've spent the interval time acquiring better lenses than the kit lens I originally purchased rather than upgrade camera bodies.
3	##My old (300D) friend has served me well over the years with Battery Grip  Eye Piece Extender and a host of affordable Canon lenses that I've used for portrait and general walk-around photography.
4	##My review is more subjective that capability based - as it has renewed interest in portions of my hobby I've not experienced since the 35mm film days.
5	##This purchase has supercharged my excitement in digital photography like nothing since my first hands on with the 300D.
6	##In looking for another camera body and lens combination - I considered the XT/XTi series but my attention quickly turned to the newest 40D.
7	##I'm a serious semi-pro (do extensive portrait work for formal charity fund raising events) and wanted to upgrade to a second camera body and give my charities the finest portrait work I could afford.
8	##The 40D had enough features (many still being practiced from the manual-highly recommended) that allowed me to invest in this next generation camera body.
9	##I ordered the camera with the BG-E2 battery grip - Eyepiece Extender with a diaptor insert to compensate for my eyeglasses) side hand strap (which I absolutely LOVE) and the 28-135mm 'kit' lens to compliment my 'portrait posse' 50mm f1.8 and prime 85mm 
10	##The body of the 40D is solid as a rock - the kevlar/plastic 300D never gave me problems - but... this inspires more 'confidence' to last a longer time (more camera - less expendable computer feel).
11	##The fps for action shots is outstanding - on a 4 gig CF memory card (SanDisk Extreme II) is adequate for my needs and pocketbook).
12	##Added to this was an upgrade from my 420EX TTL speedlight with a newer 580EXII ETTL which is giving me BEAUTIFUL indoor high ceilinged shots (using a flash diffuser) with no blowouts to date and great exposures over a variety of indoor situations.
13	##The 420EX is now a wonderful slave unit to the 580EXII.
14	##I'm now shooting RAW instead of JPEG for the majority of my shots and the difference is noticable.
15	##Better able to tweek these RAW images in photoshop also.
16	##If I'm sounding like a kid with a new toy - well - yes!
17	##This rig and upgraded accessoriues has breathed a little excitement into this digital photographer.
18	##The 3 LCD  Liveshot capabilities and IS 28-135 lens has given me a burst of creativity on the MACRO side not present with other lenses I have owned.
19	##A new light tent has renewed my interest in my wristwatch hobby with wonderful macro shots.
20	##This camera body exceeds my present digital photo experience - but as I go thru the manual I'm learning so many useful items on focus range  manual exposure techniques  ISO  and speedlight boundaries the 300D never had.
21	##It will be about another month or so before I am comfortable again with my ability to better utilize this camera than my 300D mainstay.
22	##This camera is not for everybody - the XT/XTi being a great pro-sumer body for the 'average' recreational photographer (jmho).
23	##As I get more serious - I can now concentrate on a series of 'L' lenses to continue my semi-pro hobby.
24	##New photographic worlds I could not imagine await me using this camera body.
25	##A camera that feels like it will last a lifetiime (until a better technology emerges anyway).

2	##5 I received the Canon EOS 40D on 9/26/07.
3	##From the time I took it out of the box and held it  I knew I was going to like this camera.
4	##Ergonomics:  I've been using a smallish Rebel XT for almost a year  so the larger size and grip of the 40D was a delight.
5	##And the 40D is nice and grippy in all the right places.
6	##And all the controls fall readily to your fingertips--very ergonomic.
7	##Build quality:  It has some heft to it  which lends a sense of sturdiness and quality.
8	##Also  the extra weight provides a better balance for my EF-S 17-55 f/2.8 IS USM lens.
9	##My Rebel XT  when I had the strap around my neck with the camera hanging down in front  would tend to twist forward under the weight of the lens.
10	##With the same lens mounted to the 40D  the camera tends to stay straight--much better balance.
11	##Viewfinder:  The viewfinder is another thing that Rebel XT owners will smile about regarding the 40D.
12	##The viewfinder is much larger and brighter than the Rebel XT's.
13	##Top LCD:  The top LCD display has lots of helpful information that remains displayed at all times (f/stop in Av mode  white balance setting  est.
14	##remaining shots on card  battery indicator  metering mode  auto focus mode  exposure scale  ISO  and shooting mode (single shot  3 fps  6.5 fps  or timer)).
15	##I look at the remaining shots indication all the time.
16	##Rear LCD:  The rear LCD is huge (3-inches).
17	##And the lettering is large  bright and easy to read--much better for those of us who have difficulty seeing small writing close up.
18	##I find that it can be read even if you turn the camera almost all the way sideways to your face.
19	##Therefore  the 140 degrees viewing angle rating appears to be quite conservative.
20	##The menu options are well-organized  intuitive  and easy to navigate and use.
21	##You can set the amount of time the image displays on the rear LCD after you take the shot (Review time = Off  2 sec.
22	##4 sec.
23	##8 sec.
24	##or Hold).
25	##I did notice that  despite how very bright this display is  in bright sunlight  it is nearly impossible to see the image in the display.
26	##So  I just had to look for some shade (or shield the display from the sun somehow).
27	##Taking Pictures:  The 40D lends so much confidence  it is almost impossible to adequately describe.
28	##Especially with the excellent EF-S 17-55 lens  there seems to be no shooting situation you can't conquer.
29	##The Auto Focus (AF) locks on fast and sure with a quick beep-beep in all lighting situations.
30	##I generally have the camera set to just the center AF point  since I want to choose the specific spot I want to focus on.
31	##The 40D has a high-precision cross-type center AF point that  when used with an f/2.8 or larger lens  provides twice the sensitivity as the other AF points.
32	##Lately I've been utilizing the 40D's Highlight tone priority mode and the High ISO speed noise reduction mode.
33	##The Highlight tone priority mode expands the dynamic range from gray to bright highlights and the gradations in between become smoother.
34	##This mode forces the minimum ISO to be 200.
35	##This is no problem  since the 40D produces very low noise  even at elevated ISO speeds.
36	##I have noticed that detail in highlights is well-preserved  though I still frequently need to reduce the highlights in post-processing (I shoot RAW almost exclusively).
37	##The High ISO speed noise reduction mode applies noise reduction at all ISO speeds  which is particularly effective at high ISO speeds.
38	##This mode also reduces noise in shadows.
39	##I am having no problems with noise on this camera.
40	##And despite this in-camera post-processing  in Photoshop Elements  I still can level  saturate  sharpen  etc.
41	##to my heart's content and still wind up with a sharp image  due to the excellent 10.1 megapixel sensor  and the inherently low amount of noise it produces.
42	##Live View:  I briefly played around with the Live View mode hand-held  since I have yet to receive my new ball head I've ordered for the tripod legs I recently received.
43	##It is really convenient to move the little joy-stick on the back of the 40D to place the little box over the point of interest and zoom in 5x or 10x and manually focus to fine-adjust the focus.
44	##You can auto focus during live mode by holding down the AF On button until you hear the quick beep-beep of the AF locking on (rear screen goes blank)  then release it and the Live View display comes back on immediately.
45	##When you press the shutter release in Live View mode  it is nearly silent  since the mirror is already locked up and out of the way.
46	##[Note that you initiate Live View mode by pressing the set button in the middle of the big wheel on the back of the 40D and the mirror locks up and out of the way immediately  and you get a nearly full-screen  live view on the large rear LCD with info u
47	##]  General observations:  The battery seems to be lasting a long time  despite me playing around with the Live View mode  and spending a lot of time going through menu items and deciding which modes I want to use.
48	##As of this writing  I've taken about 200 photos (some of which are posted here for you to see).
49	##I got the 8GB Sandisk Extreme IV Compact Flash card  so I can just walk around popping off shots without worry of running out of space.
50	##I have received a Bogen-Manfrotto 055mf3 tripod  but I am waiting on the Kirk BH-1 ball head to arrive.
51	##Then  I will give the Live View mode a thorough going over.
52	##Conclusions (9/29/07):  This camera simply does all that is asked of it.
53	##There is no better camera that can be used with the top-performing Canon EF-S 17-55 lens  since the 40D is the best 1.6x crop Canon camera body  and the EF-S 17-55 lens can only be used on 1.6x crop Canons.
54	##The 40D is ergonomic  sturdy  feature-packed  high performance  high IQ  low noise  and an exceptional value.
55	##I'm sure many pro shooters will be snatching these things up  too.
56	##And I'm going to have a ball exploring all that it can do.
57	##Bravo  Canon!
