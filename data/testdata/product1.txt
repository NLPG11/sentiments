2	##I've been playing with my new Powershot D10 for about a week and really like it.
3	##I have been using Canon SLRs for 25+ years  AE1 Program  A1  Elan 7e  and Digital Rebel.
4	##When I started looking for a waterproof camera to take snorkeling  my first choice was Canon  based on my many years of satisfaction with their products  and I was very lucky that this camera was released two weeks before leaving for vacation.
5	##(Amazon had been showing the camera as available for pre-order until earlier today.
6	##I purchased mine from a local camera store.
7	##)    I'm very impressed with the picture quality on this camera.
8	##The 12 megapixel sensor  coupled with a dozen shooting modes  produce an excellent image.
9	##I'm used to controlling aperture and shutter speed on the SLR  so simply selecting portrait or night exposure mode and letting the camera do all the work just seems too easy.
10	##Or  if selecting portrait is too difficult  you can select auto and just let the camera do it all.
11	##Movie quality is also quite good.
12	##The LCD screen on the back of the camera seems huge compared to the 1 screen on my old Digital Rebel.
13	##It's a great display.
14	##The controls are conveniently arranged  and easy to use  and the associated icons displayed are both informative and intuitive.
15	##You can choose to display all the settings or turn them off and just see the image.
16	##One of the useful display options is a grid overlay on the screen to assist with shot composition and the Rule of Thirds.
17	##The optical zoom works great.
18	##By the time you get to 12x with the digital zoom  the image is kind of grainy  but that's to be expected.
19	##You can take macro photographs an inch or two from your subject.
20	##I've had trouble focusing my Digital Rebel in the dark  but Canon seems to have improved low-light focusing quite a bit.
21	##It has a manual focus feature that indicates the distance to the subject as you adjust the focus  just in case it can't get the focus right.
22	##I like the Panorama feature  which displays the previous shot on the viewfinder while you're composing the next shot  allowing the photographer to closely match subsequent shots  resulting in panoramic photos with less distortion when they're stitched t
23	##Panorama mode also locks in the exposure value of the first shot so that the exposure in subsequent shots all match the first shot.
24	##The face recognition and blink detection both seem to work well.
25	##As the camera focuses  it will zoom in on one of the faces so the photographer can verify correct focus.
26	##After the shot is taken  if someone blinked it will identify the face of the person blinking so you can take another shot.
27	##These can be turned on or off according to user preference.
28	##Images seem very crisp  which I attribute to the image stabilization features  which can also be turned on or off.
29	##I've had the camera in the sink  and it handles six inches of water with no problems.
30	##I'll see how it does with thirty two and a half more feet of water when it meets the Atlantic Ocean in a few weeks!
31	##The wrist strap attaches to any one of the four corners of the camera (convenient for carrying in either left or right hand) and seems to be pretty secure  so no worries about losing it if you get knocked over by a wave.
32	##I use Photoshop Elements  so I haven't loaded the Canon software and can't comment on that.
33	##And since I edit photos on the computer  I doubt that I'll use some of the in-camera editing features  such as black and white  sepia  color swap  and the various color enhancements.
34	##I could see that would be useful to those who print directly from the camera  without editing on a computer.
35	##The camera doesn't allow you to shoot in RAW.
36	##I generally don't shoot in RAW with my SLR  so that doesn't worry me.
37	##It has a number of white balance modes  custom white balance  and auto white balance.
38	##It seems to do a good job selecting the correct shooting conditions in auto mode.
39	##Colors appear correct.
40	##A couple of drawbacks: The camera isn't threaded so you're not able to attach filters.
41	##There's also no lens cap  and I worry about the lens surface getting damaged.
42	##For a rugged adventure camera  I'm also surprised that there's no GPS chip so that photos can be tagged with the exact location.
43	##I look at old slides taken while I was hiking and think that's neat  why can't I remember where I took that.
44	##It would be nice if the EXIF data included lattitude and longitude.
45	##(Watch Canon come out with the Powershot D10 Gold six months from now that incorporates these features.
46	##The curse of being an early adopter.
47	##)   The microphone picks up every movement your fingers make as you hold the camera  so it's difficult to capture movies without some camera noise.
48	##The speaker on the bottom of the camera is also difficult to hear when playing movies back on the camera  but movies sounds fine when I pop the memory chip into the computer and watch in Quicktime.
49	##Movies are produced in the .mov format  so you'll have to do some conversion if you want to do anything wit

2	## let the kids go crazy!
3	##4 So many of our family's vacations are at beaches  lakes  water-parks  or hikes and bringing along the sensitive digital camera has always been a problem.
4	##If I carried it then I could not get in water and I spent more time worrying whether the sand would damage it than taking pics of my family.
5	##I lost a camera on a Disney Park fun ride when water suddenly splashed into the ride and we were miserable for losing all our pics.
6	##With this camera you can drop it in water and not worry about your pics unless you lose the camera (happened to me another time when I fell overboard and dropped a camera in the open sea).
7	##I have other cameras that I have been too lazy to review but I am excited about this one so I sat down to write this review.
8	##This is like a regular Canon Camera with all the features and the added waterproof feature.
9	##It can be compared to the new SD780 IS which sells for fifty bucks less.
10	##The features are similar  except that this one is waterproof and bulkier and does not have a viewfinder (not that you can see much through a fogged up viewfinder in humid conditions).
11	##Some great features: - Good looking waterproof camera  cuteness is very important  I disliked those clear cases that you have to screw on your camera and as one reviewer reported they can still get fogged up - Rainproof/Waterproof up to 33 ft  good for 
12	##Negatives: - Slightly bulkier than your typical Canon SD  it's built for water  beach and rugged use  and it's rounder shape with no hard edges can take a fall or two - No threads for filters - No RAW mode - No lens cap but the glass shield is scratchpr
13	##The buttons have been designed for waterproof operations and the zoom in and out is done through buttons on the back of the camera rather than with the shutter button lever like with other Canon cameras.
14	##The photo and video mode is toggled through a round button next to the shutter button.
15	##The best thing about this camera?
16	##You can give it to your 6 year old to take underwater pics and not worry about it  how many other real cameras can you do that with?!
17	##Now I can float down that lazy river at the water park with my family and take some nice shots rather than running along the edge trying to capture the perfect moment.
18	##And the best thing is that this camera works just as well on land.
19	##It's the perfect no-nonsense take along everywhere (really every where! Vacation camera!
1	[t]
2	##I was disappointed in the fact that the camera does not have a setting for action shots.
3	##Used it for first time in Hawaii as I stood in the surf and took photos of son standing on boogie board.
4	##Generally the photos for other circumstances are good.
5	##Really disappointed when I used the camera in just two feet of water  just to take a photo of my son ducking his head under the water.
6	##The next day the camera was kaput  with the viewing screen obviously damaged by water.
7	##The areas inside the battery compartment and USB port appeared to be dry  so the water apparently came in elsewhere.
8	##Leaving these camera doors open dried out the screen  and the camera would turn on but work no further than that.

2	##This is a great  quick camera that focuses fast and takes good pictures.
3	##The interface is well thought out; For example  half-pressing the shutter button always takes you straight into camera mode.
4	##It's perfect for wet environments  like swimming  rafting  etc.
5	##Most of this has already been covered in other reviews  so I'll just post my biggest complaints  followed by a few tips for new owners.
6	##Complaints:  1) The camera is very thick  much thicker than I thought based on the pictures.
7	##It is almost as thick as a credit card is tall!
8	##Forget fitting it into a pocket comfortably.
9	##Basically  this camera is as thick as a regular 3X zoom PowerShot with its lens fully extended.
10	##2) Expensive  overpriced accessories.
11	##I like the strap being attachable at any of the four corners  and this has actually come in useful.
12	##I think a neck strap would be even more useful  but Canon expects me to pay $100-130 for a dingy kit (AKT-DC1) of a few straps and colored shell replacements!?
13	##No thanks!
14	##3) This is standard for Canon cameras  but it's still a major annoyance.
15	##The camera cannot be used as a USB drive when attached to a computer.
16	##I don't even understand what purpose the USB port is even supposed to serve.
17	##In short: if you forgot to bring your card reader  you're SOL.
18	##Tips:  1) Clock: You can check the current time by holding down the Func/Set button in either review or camera modes.
19	##Tilt the camera vertically to see the date too.
20	##2) Review pictures faster by turning off the fading transition between pictures.
21	##This is all the way at the bottom of the first menu in review mode.
22	##3) Put the mostly useless Print button to work: The Set Print button setting under the first menu in camera mode (all the way at the bottom.
23	##) If you set it to Rec. movie  you can start recording a video with just one button press instead of having to switch modes back and forth.

2	##I am very happy with the picture quality  construction  and the portability of the Canon PowerShot D10.
3	##I have always wanted a camera to take pictures while in and around water.
4	##My only suggestion is to add a view finder.
5	##It is difficult to frame a picture in the LCD viewfinder.
6	##The video function also worked well.
7	##Extreme care should be used when inspecting the seals around the compartment doors.
8	##If you forget to shut a compartment door; or sand  dirt  debris is around the seal -- the camera will leak.
9	##This is not a design flaw  but an issue that needs attention every time one uses the camera in water.
10	##I would not be surprised if the seals would periodically need replacement.

2	##I bought this camera for a trip to St. Croix  US Virgin Islands.
3	##I originally acquired it to take underwater pictures  since I own a nikon D40 with a 18-200 mm lens for landscape type of pictures  but I got very surprised with its quality as a general purpose camera.
4	##It takes very balanced pictures and the settings are very flexible.
5	##Whenever I went to the beach  I preferred to take the D10 instead of the bulky SLR  and it worked flawless.
6	##But it is underwater where the camera shined.
7	##I took hundreds of pictures of corals and fishes  and the quality of most of them was excellent (considering this is camera fits in your hand and it is very lightweight).
8	##I also recorded many underwater videos  which is done very nicely by the camera as well.
9	##The incorporated microphone is rather low quality  but it kind of make sense to me to avoid water intrusion I guess.
10	##I used the camera for at least 8 hours total under seawater during my 4-day trip and I did not have problems at all.
11	##I soaked it in tap water everytime I used it in the sea as stated in the manual.
12	##This camera really changed my trip.
13	##My girlfriend is actually thinking about getting another for herself since we had to share it when snorkeling.
14	##The camera is fast.
15	##Whenever I saw a nice fish around me  I turned it on and took a picture in a matter of 2-3 seconds.
16	##Most images were not blurry  which kind of surprised me.
17	##With the appropiate light (as it happens with every kind of camera)  underwater pictuers can get very very nice.
18	##The LCD is very clear underwater  and it gives you a fair idea about the picturejust taken.
19	##Flash did not work well underwater since there was a lot of reflection  so it is better to disable it and use it with proper light.
20	##I'll be uploading pictures soon.
21	##I'd recommend this camera to anyone needing an all-weather camera for amateur purposes.
22	##Although i've had it for three weeks  it seems very reliable.
23	##It is made in Japan  which i guess gives it an extra bonus IMO.

2	##I bought this camera for my trip to Maui  which I just came back from.
3	##This camera took great land and water photos.
4	##I used a lot of the different scenery settings  which was great.
5	##The foliage pictures turned out great.
6	##The only disappointment I had was when I found a green gecko on a red plant (how awesome of a contrast is that)  the details were great  but the plant looked more orange than red in my photo.
7	##Landscape mode was good for Iao Needle and Hana.
8	##Underwater pictures were great and the water wasn't too choppy on the surface.
9	##We went to Honolua Bay and the colors of the fish and coral were vibrant underwater.
10	##It was amazing  some pictures you could not even tell you were underwater.
11	##You have to get under the water and face the camera up to get nicer pictures and even though the fish were swimming  you can still capture the clear picture.
12	##The battery life for the camera is awesome!
13	##My friend had another Canon camera with the underwater case  his battery died after a few hours.
14	##My battery was still strong and I had the camera on the whole time as you never know when that cool fish will swim by.
15	##We next went to the Ka'anapali Beach outside of the hotel and unfortunately the surf was a bit rougher.
16	##However  there were turtles near the beach near Black Rock and I had the underwater setting so I took both pictures outside the water and in the water.
17	##The surf was kicking up a lot of sand  so it was hard to get a clear picture of the turtle under the water.
18	##I was getting knocked over by the waves and I'm sure my camera was hitting the sand a bit as was I  but it had no problems at all.
19	##One of my favorite pictures was using the Sunset scenery setting.
20	##The sunset was bright orange and the details of the pictures turned out great.
21	##When you look on the LCD screen  it looked a bit off  but after you took the picture  it was just magnificent.
22	##The color quality was a vibrant orange and you can see the reflection on the water and detail was just great.
23	##This is a great all around camera for land or water.
24	##It's easy to use once you read the manual and it's a Canon (need I say more).
25	##It's a recognized camera as it's bright blue and I love the large LCD screen.
26	##It really helps when your underwater taking pictures.

2	##I bought this for my wife for her Birthday and because we were going diving in Bermuda!
3	##I have a Canon SD800 and a diving case for it!
4	##While my case fogged up for some apparent reason.
5	##My wife took pictures from the top to 30 feet below of me trying to de-fog my camera somehow and the pictures came out crisp!
6	##Very impressed at 5ft and 30ft.

2	##I've had this camera for about a week and am very pleased with the results so far.
3	##It's very easy to use and takes great pictures.
4	##I love the color adjustments available in the Program mode and I like the useful special scene modes.
5	##Colors seem true to life and resolution is excellent.
6	##It also starts up within about a second or less.
7	##I took one of my best pictures ever on Memorial Day and am looking forward to taking many more in the future.
8	##The only thing I really miss on this camera is a function to control the flash output (available on my older PowerShot A620) and a lenscap would have been nice.

2	##I bought my D10 from a local camera store in Boulder  CO near our home.
3	##I also picked up the Accessories Kit (AKT-DC1).
4	##I wanted the shoulder  neck  and carabiner straps.
5	##I do a lot of hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park  so I needed something for the rapidly changing weather conditions that are common there.
6	##I also wanted the camera to be able to take a bump or two on the trails.
7	##The D10 certainly fits the bill!
8	##I am out there to simply take pictures for fun.
9	##I know there are many cameras available that will take better pictures.
10	##I didn't want the bulk of a DSLR  so I considered the Canon G10 or the new Canon SX1 IS.
11	##Fine cameras  but I worried about the weatherproofing issue.
12	##I also checked out the Tough series by Olympus  but heard the picture quality was less than average.
13	##In the end  the D10 just felt right for my situation.
14	##The picture quality  in my opinion  is quite good.
15	##I use Photoshop Elements  so I can easily enhance the ones that need it.
16	##Basically  if you want a camera that you can use just about anywhere  under adverse weather conditions  but get good pictures for a camera in this class  you should include the D10 as one of your choices.

2	##Just returned from Hawaii and the Canon D10 withstood two weeks of underwater (ocean and fresh water) and outdoor (rain and waterfall) excursions.
3	##I had my doubts but the camera worked like a champ.
4	##On the last day (after loading all of the photos onto my computer) I decided to tempt fate and took the camera down to around 25-30ft deep and tried a couple of shots just to see how it held-up at close to the advertised depth.
5	##To further tempt fate  I tried to make a point of manipulating all of the controls while I was down there.
6	##The shots came out great and the camera survived unscathed.
7	##I do have two suggestions though.
8	##Periodically wipe-off the protective lens cover because the camera can have a tendancy to autofocus on the tiny particles of ocean detritus that stick to the lens cover (and take multiple shots because you often can't tell that a shot is out of focus by
9	##My other suggestion is to buy a high-vis floating strap (like the Olympus).
10	##While the camera floats by itself  if you decide to stuff it into your pocket while you're swimming around it can slip-out.
11	##While doing my family head-count out past the reef  I noticed an orange object floating in the water about 80ft away.
12	##Without the high vis strap  I would have almost certainly lost the camera.
13	##All-in-all  I was pleased with the D10's underwater performance and durability  and it also takes excellent scenery shots (I've posted a couple of examples).
14	##In all other ways  it's basically a standard Canon compact camera (but with better than average low-light performance).
